```shell
Here is a Dockerfile for a simple HTTP application using Python: 
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
## Explanation: 

• FROM python:3.9-slim: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. It uses a lightweight version of Python 3.9. 
• WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. All subsequent commands will be executed in this directory. 
• COPY . /app: This copies all files from the current directory on your host machine to the /app directory inside the container. 
• RUN pip install -r requirements.txt: This installs the Python dependencies specified in a requirements.txt file. 
• EXPOSE 80: This exposes port 80 on the container, making the application accessible from outside. 
• CMD \["python", "app.py"]: This defines the command that will be executed when the container starts, which runs the app.py file. 

* How to use it: 

• Create a requirements.txt file: List any Python dependencies your application needs. For example: 

    flask

• Create an app.py file: Write your simple HTTP application using a framework like Flask. For example: 
```shell
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/")
    def hello():
        return "Hello, Docker!"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```
• Save the Dockerfile: Make sure the Dockerfile is in the same directory as app.py and requirements.txt. 
• Build the Docker image: Run the following command in the terminal: 

    docker build -t my-http-app .

• Run the Docker container: Run the following command: 

    docker run -p 8080:80 my-http-app

This will start the container and map port 8080 on your host machine to port 80 on the container. You can now access your application at http://localhost:8080.
